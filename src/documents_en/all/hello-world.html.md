Hi! I’m Artem and I’m JavaScript developer at Badoo in Moscow, Russia. I do some [freelance](http://sapegin.me/portfolio) and [open source](https://github.com/sapegin) too. I’m also a passionate [photographer](http://decisivemoment.ru/index_en.html) who lives with beautiful wife and two awesome (though a bit crazy) dogs.

I’ve been blogging for eight years about photography and for five years about web development in Russian but it’s the first time I’m blogging in English. I don’t speak English very well so you’ll find a lot of mistakes here. I’ll be happy to fix them with your help.

I plan to write here mostly about front-end development. Probably something about photography, my life and other things if it’s interesting for you. Feel free to drop me a line here or [there](http://sapegin.me/contacts).
